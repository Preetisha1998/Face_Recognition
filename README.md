# Face_Recognition
It is an advanced technology that helps in discerning and identifying human faces from an image or video. A system employed to perform facial recognition uses biometrics to map facial features from the photo or video. It compares this information with a large database of recorded faces to find a correct match.

# Installations:
1. conda install -c conda-forge dlib
2. pip install face_recognition

# Overwiew of the project:
This is a simple project for face recognition using 'face_recognition' package. It is an AI based package and hence it gives a good accuracy.
Sample images were taken and a database was created that contained a list of all the images as features, used for training the model. Any number of such features can be considered.
Then the test image is checked and the model returns which known person is tagged and which unknown person is tagged in the given test image.
